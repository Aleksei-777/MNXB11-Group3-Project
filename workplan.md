1 Meeting (22.10.2025) to disscuss the working plan
2 Creating and setting up the repository
3 Code for cleaning the datasets
4 Picking different examples to analyze, as seen under Analysis and graphing tasks
5 Visual representation of the analysis through different forms of graphs and diagrams
6 Group report to summarize the entire project 

Analysis and graphing tasks:
Vince - Temperature throughout a month
Aleksei - Warmest and coldest day of the year
Ossian - Difference between average city temperatures between costal and inner cities

Other tasks:
Aleksei - Data cleaning
Ossian - Release manager, group report

Workflow:
Work is to be done in the dev branch and then later merged into the main branch when it is in working condition. Only the release manager will be allowed to touch main, and that is only when dev is going to be merged into main. Merge conflicts are to be handled in 2 ways. 1: When it regards text based conflicts as with changelog it will be resolved by the release manager. 2: When it regards code, it is to be resolved by those responsible for the code outside the remote repository, mostly as a safety measure against breaking the code by trying to fix it with Githubs text editor.
